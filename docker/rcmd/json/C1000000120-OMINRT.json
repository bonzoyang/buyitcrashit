OMAERUV retrieval algorithm is developed by the US OMI Team Scientists. Dr. Omar Torres (GSFC/NASA) is the principal investigator of this product. The OMAERUV product contains Aerosol Absorption and Aerosol Extinction Optical Depths, and Single Scattering Albedo at three different wavelengths (354, 388 and 500 nm), Aerosol Index, and other ancillary and geolocation parameters, in the OMI field of view (13x24 km). Another standard OMI aerosol product is OMAERO, that is based on the KNMI multi-wavelength spectral fitting algorithm. OMAERUV files are stored in EOS Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS5). Each file contains data from the day lit portion of an orbit (~53 minutes). There are approximately 14 orbits per day. The maximum file size for the OMAERUV data product is about 6 Mbytes.
