The project involves two field campaigns and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibiting salinity extremes. SPURS employs a suite of state-of-the-art in-situ sampling technologies that, combined with remotely sensed salinity fields from the Aquarius/SAC-D, SMAP and SMOS satellites, provide a detailed characterization of salinity structure over a continuum of spatio-temporal scales. The SPURS-2 campaign involved two month-long cruises by the R/V Revelle in August 2016 and October 2017 combined with complementary sampling on a more continuous basis over this period by the schooner Lady Amber. Focused around a central mooring located near 10N,125W, the objective of SPURS-2 was to study the dynamics of the rainfall-dominated surface ocean at the western edge of the eastern Pacific fresh pool subject to high seasonal variability and strong zonal flows associated with the North Equatorial Current and Countercurrent. The Controlled Flux Technique (CFT) is a system for measuring the net heat transfer velocity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation at the ocean surface, and is a useful tool for studying the turbulence generated at the ocean surface by the impact of raindrops. CFT was employed during both SPURS-2 Revelle cruises. It involves a laser heating a small patch of water on the ocean surface, and an infrared imaging camera then tracking the resulting thermal decay.  This decay is known to be proportional to the dissipation of TKE at the water surface, which in turn can be used to scale the transfer velocity for the net heat flux.
