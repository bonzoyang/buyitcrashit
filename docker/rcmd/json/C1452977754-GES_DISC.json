Version 4 is no longer available and has been superseded by Version 5.\n\nThe 'CLIM'  products differ from their 'regular' counterparts (without the 'CLIM' in the name) by the ancillary data they use. They are Climate-Reference products, which requires homogeneous ancillary data over the climate time series.  Hence, the ECMWF-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2-3 months lag behind the regular production) reanalysis is used as ancillary data to derive surface and atmospheric conditions required by the GPROF algorithm for the 'CLIM' output. The GPROF databases are also adjusted accordingly for these climate-referenced retrievals.\n\n\nThe 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm retrieves consistent precipitation and related science fields from the following GMI and partner passive microwave sensors:\n+ TMI (TRMM)\n+ GMI, (GPM)\n+ SSMI (DMSP F11, F13, F14, F15); SSMIS (DMSP F16, F17, F18, F19)\n+ AMSR2 (GCOM-W1)\n+ MHS (NOAA 18,19) \n+ MHS (METOP A,B)\n+ ATMS (NPP)\n+ SAPHIR (MT1)\n\nThis provides the bulk of the 3-hour coverage achieved by GPM. For each sensor, there are nearrealtime (NRT) products, standard products, and climate products. These differ only in the amount of data that are available within 3 hours, 48 hours, and 3 months of collection, as well as the ancillary data used. The NRT product uses GANAL forecast fields. Standard products use the GANAL analysis product, while the climate product uses ECMWF reanalysis in order to allow for consistent data records with earlier missions.

The a-priori information will be supplied by the combined algorithm supplied by GPM's core satellite as soon after launch as feasible.
