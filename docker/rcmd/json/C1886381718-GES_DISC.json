There are typically three data files for a scene of the Earth with radiances that were measured in the visible (0.55 to 0.70 micrometer) and/or IR (10.5 to 12.6 micrometer) wavelengths with a spatial resolution of 0.9 and 8 km, respectively. Files also include time, geolocation, orbit, attitude, and telemetry information. There are three types of data files in this product: one contains IR data, one contains the IR grid information, and another contains VIS data. Each data file is structured with an AOIPS label, followed by an IPD label, and then an optional 8 telemetry records followed by a set of data records. Visible data are typically 3904 pixels by either 4000 or 2000 scan lines (5 or 2.5 minute scenes respectively). IR data are typically 976 pixels by either 500 or 250 scan lines (5 or 2.5 minute scenes respectively).
