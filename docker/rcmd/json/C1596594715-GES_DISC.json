Older versions are no longer available and have been superseded by Version 6.\n\nThe Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS)is designed to provide a best estimate of precipitation based upon matched SAPHIR-DPR observations.

However, the limitations of the DPR instrument are transferred through the retrieval scheme to the resulting precipitation products.\n\nFundamental to the design of the PRPS is the independence from any dynamic ancillary data sets: the retrieval is based solely upon the satellite radiances, a static a priori radiance-rainrate database (and index), and (static) topographical data. Critically, the technique is independent of any model information, unlike the retrievals generated through the Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) scheme: this independence is advantageous when generating products across time scales from near real-time (inaccessibility to model data) to climatological scales (circumventing trends in model data).\n\nThe algorithm is designed to generate instantaneous estimates of precipitation at a constant resolution (regardless of scan position), for all scan positions and scan lines.
