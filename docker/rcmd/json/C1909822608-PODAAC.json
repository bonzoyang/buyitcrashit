The SST data in this data set are used operationally in oceanographic analyses and forecasts by the US Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO). The MetOp satellite program is a European multi-satellite  program to provide weather data services for monitoring climate and improving weather forecasts. MetOp-A,  MetOp-B and Metop-C were respectively launched on 19 Oct 2006,  17 September 2012 and 7 November 2018. The program was jointly established by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) contributing the AVHRR sensor. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micron) and near-infrared (0.9 micron) regions, the third one is located around 4 (3.6) micron, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micron, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micron. Typically, the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive SST sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel.  The swath of the AVHRR sensor is a relatively large 2400 km. All MetOp platforms are sun synchronous and generally view the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent). The ground native resolution of the AVHRR instruments is approximately 1.1 km at nadir and degrades off nadir. This particular data set is produced from legacy Global Area Coverage (GAC) data that are derived from a sample averaging of the full resolution global AVHRR data. Four out of every five samples along the scan line are used to compute on average value and the data from only every third scan line are processed, yielding an effective 4 km spatial resolution at nadir. The v2.0 is the updated version from current v1.0 with extensive algorithm improvements and upgrades. The major improvements include: 1) Significant changes in contaminant/cloud detection; 2) Increased the spatial resolution from 9 km to 4 km; 3) Updated compliance with GDS2, ACDD 1.3, and CF 1.6; and 4) Removed the dependency on the High-resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) sensor (only available to MetOp-A/B), thus allowing for the consistent inter-calibration and the processing of MetOp-A/B/C data", "has_granules": true, "orbit_parameters": {"swath_width": "2400000.0", "period": "101.3", "inclination_angle": "98.7", "number_of_orbits": "1"}, "id": "C1909822608-PODAAC", "has_formats": false, "original_format": "UMM_JSON", "granule_count": 1170, "archive_center": "NASA/JPL/PODAAC", "has_temporal_subsetting": false, "browse_flag": true, "online_access_flag": true, "links": [{"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/browse#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/Podaac/thumbnails/AVHRRMTA_G-NAVO-L2P-v2.0.jpg"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://www.ghrsst.org/"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://ghrsst.jpl.nasa.gov"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/ghrsst/docs/G-XVII_Proceedings_Washington_Issue3.pdf"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/ghrsst/sw/generic_nc_readers"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/ghrsst/docs/GDS20r5.pdf"}, {"length": "0.0KB", "rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/allData/ghrsst/data/GDS2/L2P/AVHRRMTA_G/NAVO/v2"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://podaac-opendap.jpl.nasa.gov/opendap/allData/ghrsst/data/GDS2/L2P/AVHRRMTA_G/NAVO/v2/"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC"}], "cmr": {"title": "GHRSST Level 2P Global Sea Surface Temperature v2.0 from the AVHRR on the MetOp-A satellite produced by NAVO", "summary": "A global Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 2P data set containing multi-channel Sea Surface Temperature (SST) retrievals derived in real-time from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) level-1B data from the Meteorological Operational-A (MetOp-A) satellite.
