Data collection for this product is ongoing. \r\rNote: Edition1-CV data are for instrument validation purposes only and not suited for science publications. \r\rCER_ES9_NPP-FM5_Edition1-CV data are CERES instrument Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA) fluxes using algorithms identical to those used by ERBE, regional averages of instantaneous footprint TOA fluxes only for the hours of satellite overpass (from ES-8 Level 2 product). Edition1-CV data are for instrument validation purposes only and not suited for science publications.The ERBE-like Monthly Regional Averages (ES-9) product contains a month of space and time averaged Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data for a single scanner instrument. The ES-9 is also produced for combinations of scanner instruments. All instantaneous shortwave (SW) and long-wave (LW) fluxes at the TOA from the CERES ES-8 product for a month are sorted by 2.5-degree spatial regions, by day number, and by the local hour of observation. The mean of the instantaneous fluxes for a given region-day-hour bin is determined and recorded on the ES-9 along with other flux statistics and scene information. For each region, the daily average flux is estimated from an algorithm that uses the available hourly data, scene identification data, and diurnal models. This algorithm is like the algorithm used for ERBE. The ES-9 also contains hourly average fluxes for the month and an overall monthly average for each region. These average fluxes are given for both clear-sky and total-sky scenes.\r\rCERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful ERBE mission.
