The data were derived from laboratory measurements of whole air samples collected by Programmable Flask Packages (PFP) onboard the aircraft. During each of the six monthly campaigns, flights over the Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) domain included 25 vertical profiles, from the surface up to 6 km altitude, at locations selected to complement regular long-term vertical profiles, remote sensing data, and ground-based flux tower measurements. Measurements were initiated by the aircraft pilot at predetermined locations within each profile in order to evenly distribute flask sampling points throughout each flight.
