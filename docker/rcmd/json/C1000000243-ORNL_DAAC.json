One file contains monthly biomass measurements and net primary productivity (NPP) estimates made between June 1984 and December 1994 on an ungrazed saline grassland (MNT1) that was accidently burned in February 1986 at the Colegio de Postgraduados field station site, Montecillo, Mexico. The second file contains a shorter time series of monthly biomass measurements and NPP estimates on an adjacent saline grassland (MNT2) that was burned in May 1989, probably by local farmers following normal burning practices. Both files also contain above-and below-ground dead matter decomposition rates. There are data gaps in both files. The third file contains monthly and annual climate data for the period 1963-1989 from the Chapingo meteorological station located 5 km northeast for the study area.Annual NPP at MNT1 was calculated for 1985-1987 to determine impacts of the unexpected fire. Above-ground NPP (NPP) averaged 669.2 g/m2/yr despite post-fire decline and recovery and variable rainfall over the period. Below-ground NPP (BNPP) was higher, averaging 1,007 g/m2/yr, but with a similar post-fire decline and recovery pattern. Total NPP reflected the yearly variation in ANPP and BNPP, averaging 1,676 g/m2/yr over the 3 year period. Monthly ANPP and BNPP values for MNT2 were lower overall but were not analyzed to determine annual trends.Revision Notes: Only the documentation for this data set has been modified.
