This coastal dataset utilizes a spatial box filter to generate a spatial average of the Sigma-0 retrievals from the Level 1B dataset and obtains additional winds near the coast. Since the full resolution L1B Sigma-0 retrievals are used, all non-sea retrievals are discarded prior to the Sigma-0 averaging. Each box average Sigma-0 is then used to compute the vector cell wind using the same CMOD7 geophysical model function as in the operational OSI SAF ASCAT wind vector datasets. With this enhanced coastal retrieval, winds are computed as close to ~15 km from the coast. Each file corresponds to one complete orbit and is provided in netCDF version 3 format. The beginning of the orbit files is defined near the South Pole. ASCAT is a C-band fan beam radar scatterometer, providing two independent swaths of backscatter retrievals, aboard the MetOp-A platform in sun-synchronous polar orbit. It is a product of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) provided through the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI).
