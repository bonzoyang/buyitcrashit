The principal aim of the SLSTR instrument is to maintain continuity with the AATSR series of instruments. The SLSTR instrument design incorporates the basic functionality of AATSR in addition to new, more advanced features including a wider swath, new channels (including two channels dedicated to fire detection), and higher resolution in some channels. The principal objective of SLSTR products is to provide global and regional Sea and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST) to a very high level of accuracy (better than 0.3 K) for both climatological and meteorological applications.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the instrument and the mission, visit \"Sentinel Online\" at https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/home. \r\n\r\nThe S3A_SL_1_RBT is a Level 1B product which consist of full resolution, geolocated, co-located nadir and along track view, Top of Atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperatures (in the case of thermal IR channels) or radiances (in the case of visible, NIR and SWIR channels) from all SLSTR channels.
