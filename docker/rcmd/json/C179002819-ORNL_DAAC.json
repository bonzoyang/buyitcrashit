It can be run coupled to an atmospheric model or uncoupled, in a stand-alone mode, if an atmospheric forcing is provided. The model runs on a spatial grid that can range from one point to global. The model was designed for coupling to atmospheric numerical models. Consequently, there is a compromise between computational efficiency and the complexity with which the necessary atmospheric, ecological, and hydrologic processes are parameterized. The model is not meant to be a detailed micrometeorological model, but rather a simplified treatment of surface fluxes that reproduces at minimal computational cost the essential characteristics of land-atmosphere interactions important for climate simulations.
