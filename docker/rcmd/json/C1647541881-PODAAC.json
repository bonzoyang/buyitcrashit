The project is comprised of two field campaigns and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibiting salinity extremes. SPURS employs a suite of state-of-the-art in-situ sampling technologies that, combined with remotely sensed salinity fields from the Aquarius/SAC-D, SMAP and SMOS satellites, provide a detailed characterization of salinity structure over a continuum of spatio-temporal scales. The SPURS-2 campaign involved two month-long cruises by the R/V Revelle in August 2016 and October 2017 combined with complementary sampling on a more continuous basis over this period by the schooner Lady Amber. Focused around a central mooring located near 10N,125W, the objective of SPURS-2 was to study the dynamics of the rainfall-dominated surface ocean at the western edge of the eastern Pacific fresh pool subject to high seasonal variability and strong zonal flows associated with the North Equatorial Current and Countercurrent. Underway physical data from 6 cruises undertaken by the schooner Lady Amber during the SPURS-2 field campaign include along-track meteorological, salinity snake and fixed-hull CTD measurements at 1m and 2 m intake depths. Comparisons with nearby Revelle data facilitate evaluation of uncertainties arising from collecting data from a sailboat, and the characterization of small-scale spatial variability in the ocean and atmosphere.
