Data was collected using the CALIOP on CALIPSO and CERES Flight Model 3 (FM3), CERES Scanner, MODIS, and Cloudsat on Aqua. Data collection for this product is complete. \r\rThe CER-NEWS_CCCM_Aqua-FM3-MODIS-CAL-CS_RelB1 contains the current CERES CCCM data. The CALIPSO-CloudSat-CERES-MODIS (CCCM) data set integrates measurements from the CALIPSO CALIOP instrument, CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), CERES, and the MODIS data. The cloud and aerosol properties from CALIOP and cloud properties from the CPR are matched to a MODIS pixel and then an Aqua CERES footprint. The product contains only the CERES footprint in each scan that has the highest CALIPSO and CloudSat ground track coverage. The product consists of all cloud and aerosol properties derived from MODIS radiances included in the Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) product and computed irradiances included in the Cloud Radiative Swath (CRS) product. Two sets of SSF variables are included in the CCCM data. One set covers the entire CERES footprint and the other set is only over CALIOP and CPR ground track. CERES derived top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave (SW), longwave (LW) and window (WN) irradiances by angular distribution models are also included. In addition, irradiance profiles computed by a radiative transfer model using MODIS, CALIOP, and CPR derived aerosol, clouds, and surface properties are included in the product. Furthermore, MODIS-derived cloud properties from the algorithm that incorporates CALIOP and CPR cloud information are also included. \r\rMODIS-derived cloud properties and TOA irradiances derived from CERES radiances are produced by the same algorithm that produces CERES SSF and CRS products. However, the CCCM product should not be considered as a climate data record since various input data product versions and algorithm modifications will occur along the course of the measurement period. The scan and packet numbers unique to the CERES footprint provide the means to match the data to other CERES products, although the CCCM product contains more near nadir CERES footprints compared with SSF and CRS products. The resulting HDF granule contains 24 hours of data.CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program.
