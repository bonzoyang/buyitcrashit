The GFCC Surface Reflectance Estimates Multi-Year Global dataset is derived from the enhanced Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets for epochs centered on the years 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010. The GLS datasets are composed of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30 meter resolution. Data available for this product represent the best available \u201cleaf-on\u201d date during the peak growing season. The original GLS datasets were enhanced with supplemental Landsat images when data were incomplete for the epoch or inadequate for analysis due to acquisition during \u201cleaf-off\u201d seasons. The enhanced GLS data were acquired June 1984 through August 2011. Atmospheric corrections were applied to seven visible bands to estimate surface reflectance by compensating for the scattering and absorption of radiance by atmospheric conditions. GFCC30SR is a multi-file data product. The surface reflectance data products are used as source data for other datasets in the GFCC collection.\r\n\r\nFor each available date, data files are delivered in a zip folder that consists of six surface reflectance bands, a Top of Atmosphere temperature band, an Atmospheric Opacity layer, and the Landsat Surface Reflectance Quality layer.
