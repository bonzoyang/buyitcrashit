The FLASHFlux data product is a rapid release product based upon the algorithms developed for and data collected by the CERES project. CERES is currently producing world-class climate data products derived from measurements taken aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua spacecrafts. While of exceptional fidelity, these data products require a considerable amount of processing time to assure quality, verify accuracy, and assess precision. The result is that CERES data are typically released up to six months after acquisition of the initial measurements. For climate studies, such delays are of little consequence especially considering the improved quality of the released data products. Thus, FLASHFlux products are not intended to achieve climate quality.FLASHFlux data products were envisioned as a resource whereby CERES data could be provided to the community within a week of the initial measurements, with some calibration accuracy requirements relaxed to gain speed.The Time Interpolated and Spatial Averages (TISA) is a gridded daily product that combines FLASHFlux Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) data from CERES scanner instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms. By interpolating and averaging the morning orbiter (Terra) with the afternoon orbiter (Aqua), the FLASHFlux TISA product addresses the diurnal cycle. The TISA product combines instantaneous CERES data with scene information from a higher-resolution imager such as Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites and meteorological and ozone information from the GEOS-5 FP-IT Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (GEOS-5 ADAS). The scene identification and cloud properties are defined at the higher imager resolution, and these data are averaged over the larger CERES footprint. The FLASHFlux TISA product provides a 1-degree equal angle grid of Top-of-Atmosphere fluxes in SW, LW, and NET (incoming ??? outgoing), surface fluxes using the Langley parameterized shortwave and longwave algorithms, and cloud information.CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels.
