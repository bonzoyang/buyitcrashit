Field studies of permanent vegetation plots were conducted using one sampling design over a 40-year period (1967 to 2006). The data set contains long-term measurements of diameter at breast height (DBH) determined on stratified randomly-located inventory plots within the 4 different vegetation types (oak-hickory, pine-oak-hickory, pine, and mesophytic hardwoods) located in the WBW in 1967. The WBW plot-level vegetation DBH data are provided in four files. One file contains the complete set of inventory records (139,806 observations). To accommodate spreadsheet use, the complete inventory is split into three files, one containing 52,110 observations and the other two containing 48,231 and 39,465 observations, respectively. The fifth file contains the WBW vegetation species inventory with species names, the numeric species code for each species, a species group designation, the scientific name for each species, and the literature-derived ratio of g lignin/g N for leaves of each species. NPP values have been reported for various forest stands at different locations within the WBW by Olson et al. (2012a, b; DeAngelis et al. (1997); and Esser (1998). Total NPP values range from 380 gC/m2/yr for forest stands dominated by yellow poplar to 790 gC/m2/yr for forest stands dominated by oaks.
