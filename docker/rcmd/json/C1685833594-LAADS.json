The OLCI is a push-broom imaging spectrometer that measures solar radiation reflected by the Earth at a ground spatial resolution of around 300m, over all surfaces, in 21 spectral bands whereas the SLSTR is a dual scan temperature radiometer. The principal objective of SLSTR products is to provide global and regional Sea and Land Surface Temperature (SST, LST) to a very high level of accuracy (better than 0.3 K) for both climatological and meteorological applications.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the instrument and the mission, visit \"Sentinel Online\" at https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/home. \r\n\r\nThe S3A_SY_2_SYN is a Level 2 product which consist of surface reflectances for all SYN channels and aerosol parameters over Land.
