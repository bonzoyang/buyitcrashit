Each model produced global 4-D fields (latitude by longitude by pressure for 24 hours) for one day in mid-August 2016 (nominally) of results from two simulations: first using their standard treatment of clouds (all sky or cloudy) and a second with clouds and aerosols removed (clear sky). Model resolution ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 degrees. Observed J-O1D and J-NO2 values from the first ATom deployment (29 July - 23 August 2016) were collected with the Charged-coupled device Actinic Flux Spectroradiometer (CAFS) instrument. The ATom CAFS measurements are 3-second averages along the flight path for selected remote areas over the tropical and northern Pacific Ocean.
