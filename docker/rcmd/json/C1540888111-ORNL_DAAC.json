Data were collected at 36 unburned plots with characteristics similar to the burned plots in 2016. The emission estimates were derived from a statistical modeling approach based on measurements of carbon consumption at the 211 burned field plots located in seven independent burn scars. Estimates include uncertainty of field observations of aboveground and belowground combustion, as well as prediction uncertainty from a multiplicative regression model. To apply the model across all 2014 NWT fire perimeters, the final model covariates were re-gridded to a common 30-m grid defined by the Arctic Boreal and Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) Project.
