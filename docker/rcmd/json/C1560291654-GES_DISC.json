Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 06.\n.\n\nThis is environmental data that includes the profiles of atmospheric parameters assumed in the L2 retrieval algorithm.\n\nThis GPM data type provides single- and dual-frequency-derived precipitation estimates from the Ku and Ka radars of the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on the core GPM spacecraft. The output consists of three main classes of precipitation products derived from the: \n+ the Ku-band frequency over a wide swath (245 km);\n+ the Ka-band frequency over a narrow swath (125 km), and\n+ the dual-frequency data over the narrow swath. \n\nThe Ka-band results are further divided into the standard and high-sensitivity estimates.

Dual-frequency data are expected to improve the capability to discriminate among water, ice, and mixed-phase hydrometeors as a function of height. This capability is particularly important in convective storms where a bright-band signature, associated with mixed-phase hydrometeors, is usually not detectable. In addition, the different attenuation rates of the Ku- and Ka-bands allow differential attenuation techniques to be used to estimate the path integrated attenuation.
