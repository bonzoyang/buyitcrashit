This is a PI led dataset produced at the International Pacific Research Center (IPRC) at the University of Hawaii (Manoa) School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology. The optimal interpolation (OI) mapping procedure used to create this product corrects for systematic spatial biases in Aquarius SSS data with respect to near-surface in situ salinity observations and takes into account available statistical information about the signal and noise, specific to the Aquarius instrument.  Bias fields are constructed by differencing in situ from  Aquarius derived SSS fields obtained separately using ascending and descending satellite observations  for each of the three Aquarius beams, and by removal of small-scale noise and low-pass filtering along-track using a two-dimensional  Hanning window procedures prior to application of the OI algorithm. Additional enhancements for this new version of the product include: 1) The V5.0 (end-of mission) version of Aquarius Level-2 (swath) SSS data are used as input data for the OI SSS analysis. 2) The source of the first guess fields has changed from the APDRC Argo-derived SSS product to the average of four different in-situ based SSS products. 3) The bias correction algorithm has changed to adjust SSS retrievals for large-scale systematic biases on a repeat-track basis. 4) New, less restrictive thresholds are implemented to filter observations for land and ice contamination, thus improving coverage in the coastal areas and semi-enclosed seas. 5) Level-2 RFI masks for descending and ascending satellite passes  are used to discard observations in specific geographic zones where excessive ascending-descending differences are observed due to contamination from undetected RFI. The Aquarius instrument is onboard the AQUARIUS/SAC-D satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and the Argentinian Space Agency Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). The instrument consists of three radiometers in push broom alignment at incidence angles of 29, 38, and 46 degrees incidence angles relative to the shadow side of the orbit.

The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.413 GHz in their respective horizontal and vertical polarizations (TH and TV). A scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz measures ocean backscatter in each footprint that is used for surface roughness corrections in the estimation of salinity.
