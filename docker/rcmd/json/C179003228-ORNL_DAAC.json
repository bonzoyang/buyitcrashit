Data provided in this data set were used to develop a methodology for processing and applying high resolution bathymetric data acquired with a Lowrance-480M ecosounder in the Amazon floodplain. This research was supported by the addition of Landast/TM images for planning and executing the survey. 4600 km of transects were processed semi-automatically and integrated into a georeferenced database.
