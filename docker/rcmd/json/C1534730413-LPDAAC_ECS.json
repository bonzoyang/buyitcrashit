The ECO3ETALEXIU data product is derived using a physics-based surface energy balance (SEB) algorithm, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) Disaggregation algorithm (disALEXI). Described in the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/332/ECO3ETALEXIU_ATBD_V1.pdf), disALEXI is based on spatial disaggregation of regional-scale fluxes from the ALEXI SEB model. Many approaches exist for mapping ET spatially; however, SEB methods are favored for remote sensing retrievals based on land-surface temperature. ALEXI was initially developed for managed landscapes. Applications include crop water use, crop phenology monitoring, and drought early warning or water stress detection. The output ET is generated on a UTM grid at a spatial resolution of 30 meters.\r\n\r\nThe ECO3ETALEXIU Version 1 data product contains layers of daily ET, ET uncertainty, and associated quality flags.
