The ERBE instruments fly on a mid-inclination National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite (Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS)) and two sun-synchronous National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites (NOAA-9 and NOAA-10). Each satellite carries both a scanner and a nonscanner instrument package.The scanner instrument package contains three detectors to measure shortwave, longwave, and total waveband radiation. Each detector scans the Earth perpendicular to the satellite groundtrack from horizon-to-horizon. The detectors are thermistors which use space views on every scan as a reference point to guard against drift. The total channel has no filter and so absorbs all wavelength. The shortwave channel has a fused silica filter which transmits only shortwave radiation. The longwave channel has a multilayer filter on a diamond substrate to reject shortwave energy and accept longwave. The S-9 contains inverted daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave and longwave radiant fluxes at the top-of-the atmosphere which have been averaged into 2.5 degree regions. A S-9 data set is produced for each satellite (ERBS, NOAA-9, and NOOA-10) and the combination of satellites which are operational during the data month. The data set contains a 30 byte header, 67 scale factors which are used to scale the data in the first record, and 26 scale factors which are used to scale the data in the second record. The data set also contains two types of records for each processed region. The first record is of fixed length (1860 words) and contains averaged data. The second record is of variable length containing individual hour box estimates. The length of the second record, in words, is calculated by multiplying the number of hour boxes (1846th word of record one) by the number of values passed by hour box which is 32 for the scanner.", "has_granules": true, "time_end": "1990-02-28T23:59:59.000Z", "orbit_parameters": {}, "id": "C1000000769-LARC_ASDC", "has_formats": false, "original_format": "DIF10", "granule_count": 168, "archive_center": "NASA/LARC/SD/ASDC", "has_temporal_subsetting": false, "browse_flag": false, "online_access_flag": true, "links": [{"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://doi.org/10.5067/ERBE/S9_NAT_L3"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C1000000769-LARC_ASDC"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/documents/erbe/read_software/gbytes.c"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/documents/erbe/read_software/io.c"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/documents/erbe/guide/erbe_s9_s10.pdf"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/citing-data"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/documents/erbe/readme/readme_erbe_s9_nat.txt"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/documents/erbe/read_software/s9-10_readsoftware.zip"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/documents/erbe/read_software/s9tape_regions.txt"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/ERBE"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/GEWEX-RFA"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/sensing-our-planet/a-burning-question"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/sensing-our-planet/absorption-of-solar-radiation-by-clouds-observations-versus-models"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/QuestionConvection"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://forum.earthdata.nasa.gov/app.php/tag/ERBE"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/documents/erbe/guide/erbe_project.pdf"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/documents/erbe/readme/erbe_overview.pdf"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/documents/tools/view_hdf.pdf"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CloudsInBalance"}], "cmr": {"title": "Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) S-9 Scanner Radiant Flux", "summary": "ERBE_S9_NAT data set contains inverted daily, monthly hourly, and monthly averages of shortwave (SWF) and longwave (LWF) radiant fluxes at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) for ERBE scanner data in native format for one month.The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multi-satellite system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget.
