Goals for HS3 included: assessing the relative roles of large-scale environment and storm-scale internal processes; and addressing the controversial role of the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) in tropical storm formation and intensification as well as the role of deep convection in the inner-core region of storms. HIWRAP uses solid state transmitters along with a novel pulse compression scheme that results in a system that is considerably more compact and requires less power than typical radars used for precipitation and wind measurements. By conically scanning at 10-20 rpm, its beams sweeped below the Global Hawk collecting Doppler velocity/reflectivity profiles. The unique HIWRAP sampling and phase correction strategy implemented (frequency diversity Doppler processing technique). HIWRAP's dual-wavelength operation enables it to map full tropospheric winds from cloud and precipitation volume backscatter measurements, derive information about precipitation drop-size distributions, and estimate the ocean surface winds using scatterometry techniques. Winds will be retrieved using a gridding approach similar to well-established ground-based multi-Doppler radar wind analyses.
