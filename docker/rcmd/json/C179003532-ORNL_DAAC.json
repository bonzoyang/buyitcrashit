The objectives of the ABRACOS were to monitor Amazonian climate and improve the understanding of the consequences of deforestation and to provide data for the calibration and validation of GCMs and GCM sub-models of Amazonian forest and post-deforestation pasture (Shuttleworth et al, 1991). Three areas were instrumented, each with different soils, dry season intensities and deforestation densities (Gash et al, 1996). In each area, an automatic weather station and soil moisture measurement equipment were installed: in a primary forest site and in nearby cattle pasture, for monitoring climate and soil status throughout the year. Additional intensive periods of study (or Missions), of varying duration, were operated at these sites: for calibration purposes, to understand the physical processes relevant to each site, and for detailed comparisons between sites.
