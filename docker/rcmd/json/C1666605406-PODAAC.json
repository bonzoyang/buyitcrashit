SMAP-SSS V4.2 is a complete reprocessing of the entire mission series following on from the reprocessing of the source L1B-TB data by the SMAP mission on 6/4/2018. Updates in v4.2 include: improvement in the brightness temperature (TB) calibration using an adjusted reflector emissivity, inclusion of a Sea Surface Temperature (SST) dependent flat surface emissivity model, use of updated land correction tables, and inclusion of averaged ice concentration ancillary data in the v4.2 product. The JPL SMAP-SSS L2B CAP product includes data for a range of parameters: derived SMAP sea surface salinity, SSS uncertainty and wind speed/direction data for extreme winds, brightness temperatures for each radiometer polarization, ancillary reference surface salinity, ice concentration, wind and wave height data, quality flags,  and navigation data. Each data file covers one 98-minute orbit (15 files per day).  Data begins on April 1,2015 and is ongoing, with a 3 day latency in processing and availability.
