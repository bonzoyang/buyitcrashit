The tropospheric fields are the 12 GMT gridded fields which are part of the Global Daily Assimilation System (GDAS), where data from radiosondes, aircraft, satellites, ships, bouys, or any other conventional means are assimilated and merged into meteorological fields (heights, temperature, winds). The stratospheric analyses are 12 GMT operational analyses at the 70 - 0.4 mb pressure levels produced from satellite temperature retrievals and RAOBS via a modified Cressman analysis.
