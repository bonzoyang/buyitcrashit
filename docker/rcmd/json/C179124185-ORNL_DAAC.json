The land-use history was based on several sources including: spatial distribution of potential vegetation in 1700, spatial patterns of cropland from 1700 to 1990, regional estimates of land use and logging from 1700 to 1990, and U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data on the current age distribution of forest stands.
