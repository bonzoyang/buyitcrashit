The coverage is from August 1999 through October 2009. The QuikSCAT Project produced this dataset in support of the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) under the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and was first made available via the Earth System Grid. This dataset was derived directly from the Version 2 QuikSCAT Level 2B 25-km dataset, which can be accessed here: https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/QSCAT_LEVEL_2B_V2.

This wind vector dataset is designed to be used in conjunction with the complete wind vector dataset, which include separate dataset files for both the Eastward component and total wind speed of the wind vector.
