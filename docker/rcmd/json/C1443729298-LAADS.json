This product also provides standard deviations, quality assurance weighted means and other statistically derived quantities for each parameter. \n\nThe MYD08_D3 contains roughly 600 statistical datasets that are derived from approximately 80 scientific parameters from four Level-2 MODIS Atmosphere Products: MOD04_L2, MOD05_L2, MOD06_L2, and MOD07_L2. Statistics are computed over a 1 degree equal-angle lat-lon grid that spans a 24-hour (0000 to 2400 Greenwich Mean Time) interval. Since the grid cells are 1 degree by 1 degree, the output grid is always 360 pixels in width and 180 pixels in length.\n\nMYD08_D3 product files are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). Each gridded global parameter is stored as Scientific Data Sets (SDS) within the file. \n\nThe MODIS Daily Product will be used in the simultaneously study of clouds, water vapor, aerosol , trace gases, land surface and oceanic properties, as well as the interaction between them and their effect on the Earth's energy budget and climate. This product will also be used to investigate seasonal and inter-annual changes in cirrus (semi-transparent) global cloud cover and cloud phase with multispectral observations at high spatial resolution.\n\nFor more information about the MYD08_D3 product, please visit the MODIS-Atmosphere site at:\nhttps://modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/daily", "has_granules": true, "orbit_parameters": {}, "id": "C1443729298-LAADS", "has_formats": false, "original_format": "DIF10", "collection_data_type": "SCIENCE_QUALITY", "granule_count": 6633, "has_temporal_subsetting": false, "browse_flag": false, "online_access_flag": true, "links": [{"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MYD08_D3.061"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/daily"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/ModAtmo/L3_C61_Changes_v2.pdf"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/ModAtmo/L3_ATBD_C6_C61_2019_02_20.pdf"}, {"length": "0.0KB", "rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/search/order/2/MYD08_D3--61"}, {"length": "0.0KB", "rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/archive/allData/61/MYD08_D3/"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#", "type": "text/html", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/opendap/allData/61/MYD08_D3/contents.html"}], "cmr": {"title": "MODIS/Aqua Aerosol Cloud Water Vapor Ozone Daily L3 Global 1Deg CMG", "summary": "The MODIS/Aqua Aerosol Cloud Water Vapor Ozone Daily L3 Global 1Deg CMG product (MYD08_D3) contains daily 1 x 1 degree grid average values of atmospheric parameters related to atmospheric aerosol particle properties, total ozone burden, atmospheric water vapor, cloud optical and physical properties, and atmospheric stability indices.
