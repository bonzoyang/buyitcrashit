There are typically three data files for a scene of the Earth with radiances that were measured in the visible (0.55 to 0.70 micrometer) and/or IR (10.5 to 12.6 micrometer) wavelengths with a spatial resolution of 0.9 and 8 km, respectively. Files also include time, geolocation, orbit, attitude, and telemetry information. There are three types of data files in this product: one contains IR data, one contains the IR grid information (blank before 1974/10/29), and another contains VIS data. Each data file is structured with an AOIPS label, followed by an IPD label, and then an optional 8 telemetry records followed by a set of data records. Visible data are typically 3904 pixels by either 4000 or 2000 scan lines (5 or 2.5 minute scenes respectively).
