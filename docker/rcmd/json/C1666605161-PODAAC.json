SMAP-SSS V4.2 is a complete reprocessing of the entire mission series following on from the reprocessing of the source L1B-TB data by the SMAP mission on 6/4/2018.

Daily data files for this L3 product are based on SSS averages spanning an 8-day moving time window.  Associated file variables include: derived SSS with associated uncertainties and wind speed data from SMAP, ancillary ice concentration and HYCOM surface salinity data.
