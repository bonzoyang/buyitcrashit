This dataset provides nominal 4.45 km (pixel resolution at reference latitude 70 N) gridded fields that classify First-Year (FY) and Multi-Year (MY) sea ice  using SeaWinds on QuikSCAT scatterometer observations on a daily basis from 20 June 2002 through 23 November 2009. It is unique from other sea ice classification datasets primarily due to its utilization of passive microwave AMSR-E data to provide the initial ocean/ice masking edge and the use of a seasonal threshold for FY and MY sea ice classification from only SeaWinds data.The dataset is derived from daily gridded QuikSCAT vertically polarized (V-pol) egg backscatter data from the SCP, which is made available at the PO.DAAC: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/QUIKSCAT_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ENHANCED . A seasonally varying threshold was derived by Swan and Long (2012) and used to discriminate between FY and MY sea ice based on QuikSCAT V-pol egg backscatter. The sea ice mask was derived by applying threshold constraints to the SCP AMSR-E 6 GHz images, which are made available by the BYU SCP: http://www.scp.byu.edu/data/AMSRE/SIR/AMSRE_sir.html .
