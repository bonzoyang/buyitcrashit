The project is comprised of two field campaigns and a series of cruises in regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans exhibiting salinity extremes. SPURS employs a suite of state-of-the-art in-situ sampling technologies that, combined with remotely sensed salinity fields from the Aquarius/SAC-D, SMAP and SMOS satellites, provide a detailed characterization of salinity structure over a continuum of spatio-temporal scales. The SPURS-2 campaign involved two month-long cruises by the R/V Revelle in August 2016 and October 2017 combined with complementary sampling on a more continuous basis over this period by the schooner Lady Amber. Focused around a central mooring located near 10N,125W, the objective of SPURS-2 was to study the dynamics of the rainfall-dominated surface ocean at the western edge of the eastern Pacific fresh pool subject to high seasonal variability and strong zonal flows associated with the North Equatorial Current and Countercurrent. A Waveglider is an autonomous platform propelled by the conversion of ocean wave energy into forward thrust and employing solar panels to power instrumentation. For SPURS-2, sensors included a CTD at the near-surface and another at 6 m depth, providing continuous salinity and temperature observations plus air temperature and wind measurements.  Three wavegliders (ASL22, 32, 42) were deployed from the Revelle in August 2016 and again in November 2017 before final retrieval at the conclusion on the second cruise.
