Each data file contains a segment of the Earth with radiances that were measured in the visible (0.55 to 0.70 micrometer) and/or IR (10.5 to 12.6 micrometer) wavelengths with a spatial resolution of 0.9 and 8 km, respectively. Files also include time, geolocation, orbit, attitude, and telemetry information. A data file is structured with a header, followed by an IR scan line and then 8 visible scan lines (although some files only contain IR scans). Visible scans are at full resolution of 15288 pixels and a file will contain several hundred scan lines. IR scans are at 3822 pixels and up to a hundred scan lines. A full scan of the Earth was made every 20 minutes.\n\nData for this product are only available for 9 days: 1974/08/23 (IR only), 1974/08/27 (IR only), 1974/08/31, 1974/09/01, 1974/09/02, 1974/09/05, 1974/09/24 (IR only), 1975/01/10, and 1975/02/17.
