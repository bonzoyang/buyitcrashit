The influence of the crosstalk has gradually increased over the mission lifetime, causing for example, earth surface features to become prominent in atmospheric band 27, increased detector striping, and long term drift in the radiometric bias of these bands. The drift has compromised the climate quality of C6 Terra MODIS L2 products that depend significantly on these bands, including cloud mask (MOD35), cloud fraction and cloud top properties (MOD06), and total precipitable water (MOD07).
