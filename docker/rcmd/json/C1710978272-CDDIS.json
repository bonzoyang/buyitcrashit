GNSS provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS data sets from ground receivers at the CDDIS consist primarily of the data from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Since 2011, the CDDIS GNSS archive includes data from other GNSS (Europe\u2019s Galileo, China\u2019s Beidou, Japan\u2019s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System/QZSS, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System/IRNSS, and worldwide Satellite Based Augmentation Systems/SBASs), which are similar to the U.S. GPS in terms of the satellite constellation, orbits, and signal structure. DCBs are the systematic errors, or biases, between two GNSS code observations at the same or different frequencies.

Proper knowledge of DCBs is crucial to many navigation applications but also non-navigation applications such as ionospheric analysis and time transfer. With all of the new signals offered by modernized and new GNSS constellations, analysts now require a comprehensive multi-GNSS DCB product.
