Below-ground biomass was also measured, but the data are not reported in this data set. Annual above-ground net primary production (ANPP) was estimated by several calculation methods, including peak total live plus current dead matter; sum of species maxima (biomass + dead material); single square clippings; and variations of these equations. The rate of disappearance of dead material and mortality were also determined. Mean ANPP estimates ranged from 324 g/m2/yr (max live + dead) to 430 g/m2/yr (taken as the mean of the two sites accounting for disappearance of dead matter).
