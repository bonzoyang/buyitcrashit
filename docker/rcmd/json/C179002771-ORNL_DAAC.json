This site is in the Tapajos National Forest located in north central Brazil. Measurements extend from January 2002 through January 2006.H2O concentrations were measured at 8 levels on the tower (62.2, 50, 39.4, 28.7, 19.6, 10.4, and 0.91 m). Sample air was drawn at 1000 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute) through 8 profile inlets in sequence (2 minutes at each level) and then a mixed air sample was simultaneously drawn from all 8 levels to obtain a total column integral (once every 20 minutes) and analyzed with an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA, LI-6262, Licor, Lincoln, NE). Data were averaged over a 1 hour interval. Calibration for H2O used two independent calibrations for the IRGA concentration measurements: (a) the nighttime relationship between ambient temperature measurements and sonic temperature measurements; (b) a chilled mirror dew point hygrometer mounted on the tower.
