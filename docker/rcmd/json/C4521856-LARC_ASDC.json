Data was collected using the CERES Scanner and FM4 on the Aqua platform. Data collection for this product is complete. \r\rCER_FSW_Aqua-FM4-MODIS_Edition2B includes legacy data covering regional averages of instantaneous footprint computed fluxes [Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA), surface, and in-atmospheric (profile)], associated TOA observed fluxes, and cloud parameters only for the hours of satellite overpass (from the Clouds and Radiative Swath (CRS) level2 product). The Monthly Gridded Radiative Fluxes and Clouds (FSW) product contains a month of space and time averaged CERES data for a single scanner instrument. The FSW is also produced for combinations of scanner instruments. All instantaneous fluxes from the CERES CRS product for a month are sorted by 1-degree spatial regions and by the Universal Time (UT) hour of observation. The mean of the instantaneous fluxes for a given region-hour bin is determined and recorded on the FSW along with other flux statistics and scene information. The mean adjusted fluxes at the four atmospheric levels defined by CRS are also included for both clear-sky and total-sky scenes. In addition, four cloud height categories are defined by dividing the atmosphere into four intervals with boundaries at the surface, 700-, 500-, 300-hPa, and TOA. The cloud layers from CRS are put into one of the cloud height categories and averaged over the region. The cloud properties are also column averaged and included on the FSW.\r\rCERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program.
