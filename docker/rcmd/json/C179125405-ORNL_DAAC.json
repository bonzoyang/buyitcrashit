The data provided are the latitude/longitude, brightness temperature, estimates of sub-pixel fire size and temperature, Global Land Cover Characterization (GLCC) ecosystem type, and a pixel-fire flag (0-5, information regarding the probability of a fire or processing characteristics) for each active fire detected by WF_ABBA for a 30 minute imager interval.
