The HRIR flown on Nimbus-3 was modified to allow nighttime and daytime cloud cover mapping  by use of dual band-pass filter which transmits 0.7 to 1.3 micron, and 3.4 to 4.2 micron radiation.  The HRIR instrument was launched on the Nimbus-3 satellite and was operational from April 14, 1966 through July 22, 1969. Nighttime operation was made in the 3.4 to 4.2 micron near infrared region.  Daytime operation was based on the predominance of reflected solar energy in the 0.7 to 1.3 micron region.  Change-over from nighttime to daytime operation was accomplished automatically (or by ground station command), by actuating a relay in the early stages of the radiometer electronics.  The system gain was reduced in the daytime mode to compensate for the higher energy levels.\n\nThis product was previously available from the NSSDC with the identifier ESAD-00222 (old ID 69-037A-02C).", "has_granules": true, "time_end": "1970-03-21T23:59:59.999Z", "orbit_parameters": {}, "id": "C1273652190-GES_DISC", "has_formats": false, "original_format": "UMM_JSON", "collection_data_type": "SCIENCE_QUALITY", "granule_count": 1278, "archive_center": "NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/GESDISC", "has_temporal_subsetting": false, "browse_flag": true, "online_access_flag": true, "links": [{"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/browse#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://docserver.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/public/project/Images/HRIRN3L1_001.png"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/metadata#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datacollection/HRIRN3L1_001.html"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://acdisc.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/Nimbus3_HRIR_Level1/HRIRN3L1.001/"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=HRIRN3L1"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://acdisc.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/Nimbus3_HRIR_Level1/HRIRN3L1.001/doc/README.HRIRN3L1.001.pdf"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://docserver.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/repository/Mission/Nimbus/3.3_Product_Documentation/3.3.5_Product_Quality/NimbusIIIUG.pdf"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://docserver.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/repository/Mission/Nimbus/3.3_Product_Documentation/3.3.5_Product_Quality/DataCatalogNimbus3.tar.gz"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://nsidc.org/data/nimbus/data-sets.html"}, {"rel": "http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#", "hreflang": "en-US", "href": "https://docserver.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/public/project/Nimbus/N3_HRIR_Inventory.xlsx"}], "cmr": {"title": "HRIR/Nimbus-3 Level 1 Meteorological Radiation Data V001 (HRIRN3L1) at GES DISC", "summary": "HRIRN3L1 is the High Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HRIR) Nimbus-3 Level 1 Meteorological Radiance Data (NMRT) product and contains infrared radiances converted to equivalent black-body temperature or \"brightness\" temperature values.
