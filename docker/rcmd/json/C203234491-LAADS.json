The Level-1A data is separated into granules for passage to the geolocation and calibration processes. Quality indicators are added to the data to indicate missing pixels and instrument modes. This product contains MODIS digitized raw detector counts data for all 36 MODIS spectral bands, at 250 m, 500 m, or 1 km spatial resolutions including all time tags, all detector views (Earth, solar diffuser, Spectro-Radiometeric Calibration Assembly (SRCA), black body, and space view), and all engineering and ancillary data.
