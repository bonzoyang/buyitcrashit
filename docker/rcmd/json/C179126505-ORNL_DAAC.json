CO2 (ebullitive and diffusive) and CH4 diffusive flux measurements were made one day each month from February 2005 through January 2006 in both permanently and seasonally flooded areas. For the remaining days of each month, fluxes were calculated as the mean of the two measurements bracketing that time period, times the area flooded each day.
