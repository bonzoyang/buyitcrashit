Second, it addresses the spatial discontinuity north of 72 degrees N, by using SeaWiFS, in addition to SPOT VGT, to calibrate between the second and third versions of the AVHRR sensor (AVHRR/2 and AVHRR/3). Finally, the GIMMS 3g algorithm incorporates improved snowmelt detection and is calibrated based on data from the shorter, arctic growing season (May-September) rather than the entire year (January-December).
