The retrievals are provided on a non-uniform grid within the swath at 12.5 km pixel resolution. Higher resolution is achieved through a slice composite technique in which high resolution slice measurements from L1B data are composited into a 12.5 km wind vector cell. Version 3 processing begins with the same L1B (time-ordered backscatter) data as used in the previous processing. Version 3 has several improvements over the previous JPL processing of the QuikSCAT L2B winds: 1) changes to measurement binning, which was done in order to decrease noise and reduce gaps in the 12.5 km L2B wind retrievals, 2) an improved geophysical model function (GMF) to model the effect of wind on backscatter, 3) a neural network approach to correct rain contaminated winds speeds, 4) cross-track dependent wind speed biases were estimated and removed from the wind retrievals. The 12.5 km binning resolution enables users to obtain wind vector retrievals 10 km closer to shore when compared to the 25 km L2B dataset (only available in versions 1 and 2).
