Files also include time, geolocation, orbit, attitude, and telemetry information. A data file is structured with a header, followed by an IR scan line and then 8 visible scan lines (although some files only contain IR scans). Visible scans are at full resolution of 15288 pixels and a file will contain several hundred scan lines. IR scans are at 3822 pixels and up to a hundred scan lines.
