This dataset contains estimates of static field geopotential of the Earth, derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission measurements, produced by the Center for Space Research (CSR) at University of Texas at Austin.  The data are in spherical harmonics averaged over approximately a month.  The primary objective of the GRACE mission is to obtain accurate estimates of the mean and time-variable components of the gravity field variations.  This objective is achieved by making continuous measurements of the change in distance between twin spacecraft, co-orbiting in about 500 km altitude, near circular, polar orbit, spaced approximately 200 km apart, using a microwave ranging system.  In addition to these range change, the non-gravitional forces are measured on each satellite using a high accuracy electrostatic, room-temperature accelerometer.

Spatial and temporal variations in the gravity field affect the orbits (or trajectories) of the twin spacecraft differently.
