In combination with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AIRS constitutes an innovative atmospheric sounding group of visible, infrared, and microwave sensors. The HSB level 1B data set contains HSB calibrated and geolocated brightness temperatures in degrees Kelvin. This data set is generated from HSB Level 1A digital numbers (DN), including 4 microwave channels in the 150 - 190 GHz region of the spectrum. A day's worth of data is divided into 240 scenes each of 6 minute duration. For the HSB measurements, an individual scene consists of 135 scanlines containing 90 cross-track footprints; thus there is a total of 135 x 90 = 12,150 footprints per HSB scene, which coincide very closely with the AIRS infrared footprints. HSB is primarily a humidity sounder that provides information on snow/ice cover and precipitation using the 150 GHz window channel, and the coarse distribution of moisture in the troposphere using the 183 GHz channels. Combined with simultaneous measurements from the AIRS and AMSU-A instruments, the calibrated HSB brightness temperatures will be used to initialize the atmospheric moisture profile required for the retrieval of the final AIRS geophysical products.
